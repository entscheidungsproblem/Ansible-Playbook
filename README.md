# Ansible-Playbook

Ansible roles to setup [Void Linux](https://voidlinux.org/) for my personal laptop/destop and my media server. I often switch between devices and wanted an easy way to speed things up.

I left some sections broken or incomplete because I decided to switch to [NixOS](http://nixos.org/) because it uses a "completely declarative approach to configuration management" which allows me to keep (almost) all of my config in one [file](https://github.com/entscheidungsproblem/.dotfiles/blob/master/configuration.nix).
